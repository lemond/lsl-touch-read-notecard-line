read notecard line with touch feature

This reader is very simple, but found there is no practical delay setting between reading the present followed by the next line into chat, particularly as notecards change from one to another, some with long lines, others short.  This solution comments out the delay and involves touching the reader each time to prompt the next line.  The reader itself is typically a small object worn as a HUD decorated with any texture at all, as the HUD has only one button.  There is a Nargus menu system I found and use intact.  Part of the code in the reader script calls the menu system.  Install these two scripts amd the notecards into the object, and change notecards at will.  I use this to read poetry in world.
